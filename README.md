# Reservoir_with_a_Parameter_Channel_PRR2021

A framework of parameter-aware reservoir computing, and its applications to predict critial transition, system collapse and transient chaos.

Codes of our publication: [Kong, Ling-Wei, Hua-Wei Fan, Celso Grebogi, and Ying-Cheng Lai. "Machine learning prediction of critical transition and system collapse." Physical Review Research 3, no. 1 (2021): 013090](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.013090).

We applied the same method on these three different systems. The codes of the food chain system have more comments, so you may want to begin with this system.

We have [another repository](https://github.com/lw-kong/Reservoir_with_a_Parameter_Channel_JPC2021) with the same framework applying on different problems. There are also the codes for hyperparameter optimization in that repositry.
